# Challenge-5.0-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction
This application is called "Work Day Scheduler"! This is meant to help users organize their tasks throughout the day.
They can also keep track of time at the top of the webpage, as there is date & time displayed.
## My Assignment
My assignment was to create a Work Day Scheduler that would help users organize and track their day.
Users can add tasks as well as save them to check on later on. As time goes by, the time display and task status is also
updated.
